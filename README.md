## Instructions

To get started, open [the GitHub pages site for this repo](https://https://aman-kumar-rai.github.io/blog-project/)

This is just a demo project built as a part of the udacity frontend developer nanodegree program. The task was to create a responsive blog website. The content is just a filler. It is not my actual website.

To view my actual blog website, [please click this link](https://deadshot.space)

## Dependencies

This project is built using vanilla JS in a few places. So, no javascript library is needed. Nor have i used any css frameworks.

## Contributing

This project is pretty much complete. I don't know of any bugs and i don't think that i will update the project because it's a demo for a responsive webpage. Feel free to use it in what ever way you need. In case you can spot some bug, please create a pull request. Follow the standard coding practices if you feel like creating a pull request.
