        Hi, I am Aman Kumar. I am from India. I started my career as a java developer. I designed few basic desktop applications using it. One of which was a local network based chat and file transfer application. Then i joined Mindtree Ltd, where i worked as an automation testing engineer. I didn't like the field that much, cause there is not much you can do. All the projects use mostly the same code, same framework, there was nothing in it to keep me interested. After an year, I left Mindtree due to health related issues. Then i was sitting at home, thinking about what is next for me. Then i started front end development casually, but after a few months, i realized that it is an interesting field. All the talk about front end development not being a real coding thing seemed false. Now, this is what i do. Currently, i am enrolled in the Udacity frontend developer nanodegree program hoping to learn about the field in detail and being someone who can bring the users the best experience ever.
